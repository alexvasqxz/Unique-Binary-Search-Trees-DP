# Unique-Binary-Search-Trees-DP
This program gives the number of unique Binary Search Trees that can be formed given n Nodes using Dynamic Programming

Example:
Input : 3
Output: 5

Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

1         1              2             3        3
 \         \            / \           /        /
  3         2          1   3         2        1
 /           \                      /          \
